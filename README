HTTPStat
--------
Continually monitors a URL, producing iostat- or vmstat-like output of response times.

Includes response times of external resources on the page (images, css, javascript), if
-e option is used, because the most common cause of user-perceived slowness, is external
calls to services you don't control (ad servers, analytics, etc).

Note: this script does not render the page or execute any javascript, so it's purely
measuring *server* response time to fetch the resources.

INSTALLING
----------
'pip install -r requirements.pip' will install all dependencies.

RUNNING
-------
See: ./httpstat.py --help
